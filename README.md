# XOR Encryption with CBC Mode

Programming exercise in the course of the practical lecture _Fundamentals of Programming_ (IN0002) at the Technical University of Munich.

The user is asked for a key and an initialization vector; both are numbers between 0 and 63. If the user enters invalid numbers, he/she is asked to re-enter them. Afther that, the user is asked to enter a plaintext to be decrypted. Each letter of the plaintext is mapped to a number between 0 and 63 before the encryption takes place. Afterwards, the ciphertext is decrypted again.
